Mantelpiece is a complete authenticated CMS for journalists with statically rendered MDX articles, built using the latest and greatest in NextJS (App Router), Supabase Postgres and Auth, and Tailwind+ShadCN.

At the moment, this is being used as a private CMS, but anybody is able to create an account and view their page. It will thus be easy to rearrange things to make this a platform for journalism portfolios, rather than a once-off.

Also had fun implementing a custom Hero text component for the landing/marketing page and blending in some animations in [Motion.dev](https://motion.dev/) inspired by [Emil Kowalski](https://emilkowal.ski/). Try it [out](https://mantelpiece.vercel.app/)!

Upcoming:

- Adding finalised support for markdown editing in-app.
